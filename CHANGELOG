* v1.6 - 30.03.2015
- added automatic splitting of output atlases (via -multipart)
- bug fix resulting in a performance boost when packing images
- fix some bugs related to rectangular texture atlas support
- added Travis CI support in the Github repository (mostly for pull requests)
- added an error check if a single image is larger than the target atlas
- mostly disabled the GUI part until an actually useful module is implemented
- added build scripts to generate things like Version.as and for zip release
  packages
- the repository from now on will include pre-built zip packages in ./release
- various build script fixes
- make the run scripts search for AIR_SDK_BIN if defined 
- more performance optimizations

* v1.5 - 24.03.2015
- quantize: added a fast noise shaping quantization algorithm
- quantize: optimizations for the FS algorithm
- command line: better parser
- command line: allow picking a quantization algorithm
- command line: -colorbits is now -channelbits and allows ARGB masks (e.g. 4444)
- qunatize: allow zero bits per channel via -channelbits
- file loading optimizations
- warnings and errors are now more verbose
- warnings on file skipping
- added a fancy line in the output XML saying "generated with ta-gen vX.X"
- small performance optimizations all over the place

* v1.4 - 18.03.2015
- add support for different PNG encoder options from the command line
- PNGEncoder.as optimizations and RGB (24bit) support
- added the optional PNGEncoder2 from Cameron Desrochers
- improved build scripts
- framerate and logger improvements

* v1.3 - 16.03.2015
- the UI is now off by default unless -gui is specified
- added improved error handling
- added better file extension checks
- small performance optimizations

* v1.2 - 12.03.2015
- added support for sub-texture edge extrusion

* v1.1 - 07.03.2015
- added support for quantization and dithering

* v1.0 - 21.12.2014
- initial release
